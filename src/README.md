1. generate 100 random number and assign them to an array
2. find out repeated number and assign them to an Arraylist
3. count the times of repeated numbers
4. output the repeated number and the time of appearance as a pair
5. use two different repeated number counting methods:
   one is using an arraylist numberList[] to store repeated numbers,using count[] to store the repeating times;
   another is using <k,V> pair to store repeated numbers and its repeating times, using an arraylist numberList[] to store the <k,V>
6. use javaFX to create a bar chart to display repeat numbers and their repeat times
7. skills cover: 
   random, 
   type cast, 
   array, 
   arraylist and arraylist API,    
   class and class reference
   JavaFX
